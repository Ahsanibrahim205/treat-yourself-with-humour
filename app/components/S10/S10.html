                    <h1>Learned <em>Recovery</em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>The best way to learn how to recover is through exercise, yet very few people take advantage of this powerful tool. Some studies suggest that the average person spends two and a half hours a day watching television, yet only 15 minutes per day exercising. Many people get no exercise at all. Never in the course of history have people been more inactive, and never have we been more susceptible to so many diseases. Physical activity of any kind will help protect you against coronary arterial disease, colon cancer, breast cancer, and, without question, obesity and all of its health consequences.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Exercise is a form of stress. No, it’s not in the same category as losing a job or a loved one because you are in control. Nonetheless, there are some shared features with your reaction to failure. It’s enough that you can actually use exercise as a means by which to teach yourself to cope more effectively. The common features are:</p>

                <p>How does Cross-Stress Training work? While each stressful experience and your response are unique, there are some features that occur in everyone. Thus, when your body learns to adapt to one form of stress, you are better able to cope with most other forms. It’s like learning to drive a car. No two automobiles are exactly the same; yet, having learned to drive one model, you can readily apply your basic driving skills to all others. You may have to search for the light switch or hood-release button, but the essential components are about where you would expect them. The same applies to stress. Once you learn to respond to one form of stress or failure, you will have the basic skills to respond to most all other types. Moderate exercise is a form of beneficial stress, which can be used to train recovery. Here’s how you do it.</p>         
                <br>
                <p>There are many ways people exercise. One is called steady-state aerobics. Typically, a person will exercise for a set period of time at the same intensity. They might run 5 miles or work out on a bicycle for 30 minutes. That certainly is a wonderful form of exercise, especially from the standpoint of building endurance or of burning fat.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For optimizing recovery, it is far better to oscillate through the different levels. Each time heart rate is elevated, the body is learning to adjust to greater amounts of stress. Each episode of stress is then followed by a period of recovery. Plan on spending approximately 80 percent of your workout within the moderate stress zone. This corresponds to the aerobic zone and will improve your cardiovascular fitness. The remaining time should be spent oscillating between the low and high stress zones as you create a wave-like pattern of heart rate change. This will take you to a relaxed pace all the way to the anaerobic level, which leaves you breathless. By oscillating between strenuous exercise (stress) and a relaxed pace, you are incorporating a universal principle into your workout: For every action, there must occur an equal and opposite reaction. Or, for every episode of stress, there needs to occur an equal amount of recovery. Now, recovery becomes your familiar response following an episode of stress. Eventually, it will occur on autopilot, making recovery your default response, not just to the stress of exercise, but also to the stress of everyday hassles.</p>
