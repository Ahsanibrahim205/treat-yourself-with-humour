                    <h1>Responding <em>To Adversity</em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>At the same time the brain is signaling a need for more energy, it’s also determining the best course of action. However, under extreme stress, the brain may guide you to do something based upon instinct rather than upon reason. That’s when problems may arise. When you find yourself faced with adversity, there are three likely ways of responding. Each has a purpose; however, one creates a state during which you are more likely to take action without thinking things through. You feel the need to do something, even though it may be harmful to your health and well-being.
                    It’s called the fight/flight response and can be brought on by relentless stress. Each of the three ways of responding will be discussed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The first and the most primitive way of responding is to do absolutely nothing. This is called withdrawal. I call it primitive, not because it is somehow inferior to other responses, but because it is the most basic way of responding. Low-functioning organisms - amoebas, for example, or other unicellular organisms - cannot fight or run away. All they can do is conserve energy and hope they will still be there after the crisis is over. In humans, this withdrawal response is directed by the vagus nerve, which includes the parasympathetic nervous system. This part of the nervous system inhibits digestion and lowers heart rate. It enables us to conserve energy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When studying higher- functioning organisms – for example, reptiles - we encounter the second level of responding, or the capacity to engage in action. It's what Walter Cannon called the fight or flight response. However, this doesn’t have to be to an extreme. Fighting does not have to be hauling off and slugging somebody. Fighting also can be standing your ground and not giving in. And flight need not be turning on your heels in a cowardly fashion and then running away. No. It might also be the ability to say, “Hey, we’ve worked hard this week; let’s knock off early and approach the problem again when we’re fresh on Monday morning.” Or, “How about taking a 30-minute break and see if we can clear our heads a bit.” That’s withdrawal, too. So you see, there are many different degrees of fight and flight. In humans, this action response, whether it is fight or flight, is handled, in large part, by the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is the branch that mobilizes us for action. It increases the heart and respiration rate. It makes sure that we have all the chemicals that we need to engage in the appropriate response.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As we progress along the phylogenetic scale to humans, we encounter a well-developed and highly convoluted neocortex - the outer mantle of brain tissue that encases the rest. The neocortex enables us to engage in higher processing, the third level of responding. It includes a branch of the vagus nerve that dampens the sympathetic nervous system. This keeps us from going off half-cocked as a reptile might, and it buys us time. It enables us to create images associated with what has happened in the past…compare them with images in the present…and then project into the future to formulate images associated with the different outcomes we are pondering. It is this sequential comparison of images from the past, present, and future that defines the process of thought.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Furthermore, this branch of the vagus nerve not only provides you access to your own brain; it allows you access to another person’s brain. This is the branch of the nervous system that includes the neurons that control your larynx, enabling you to speak to others and to seek advice. For example, “What did you do? What do you think I ought to do?”</p>
                <br>
                <p>But these are merely words. They can convey information, but they don’t do an effective job of conveying emotion. What establishes empathy is body language. It is very important while you are speaking with a person to move your eyebrows and to smile and frown appropriately.
                    The next time you are having a conversation with someone you feel very drawn to - someone who really seems to understand you - observe them carefully, and chances are you’ll find that they are matching their words with the appropriate body language.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The stress response can be defined as seeking safety. But what is it that we find safest? What is it we seek to surround ourselves with when we are under duress? We seek the familiar. The more familiar something is, the more likely we are to embrace it during times of stress. That’s exactly why we gravitate toward our family, the people who are the most familiar to us. Parents have been there since the beginning. Or we might turn to a sibling or close friend. The body does the same thing. During stress, your biological systems turn to the most familiar way of responding. And the most familiar way of responding, the one that’s been around the longest, is withdrawal.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Next is action, followed by the new kid on the block, which is higher processing. The stress response includes progressing through each one of these levels, depending on how much stress you happen to be under. Here’s an example of how this works.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Imagine you are dealing with a level one or level two conflict, which means the problem is the problem. Everyone agrees what the problem is. They may even agree as to how best to fix it. Plus, you have plenty of time to arrive at a solution. It is easy under these circumstances to engage in higher processing. Nothing has activated the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But now let’s increase the pressure and take this to what mediators refer to as a level three conflict. There is now disagreement, and the original problem is not the only one with which you are confronted. For some people, winning may be more important than arriving at a solution. They may start to withhold information. They distort and embellish. They don’t want to admit to anything that might be counter to their beliefs. Furthermore, if you make the wrong decision, there will be consequences.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Oh, and, by the way, you’ve only got an hour to come up with a solution. It’s at this point that a person is likely to drop from higher processing into action mode. Typically, they will throw up their hands and declare, “Let’s do something. We just can’t go on like this. I’m not going to worry about whether it’s the wrong decision. Let’s just do something and worry about the consequences afterwards.” That is a typical, behavioral action response.</p><br><p>
                    Now the pressure is incredibly intense. There will be negative consequences, regardless of which choice you make. You have arrived at level 5. People are stabbing each other in the back, and you sense that no one is going to support you, no matter what decision you make. In addition to winning, some folks in the group actually want to destroy each other, cause others to lose their job, or to suffer personally. That is when you may very well drop into the withdrawal response and say, “Look, I’ve had it. I’m not putting up with this anymore.” This is a typical withdrawal response, accompanied with some elements of flight. Realize you rarely have a pure response in biology.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Clinically, withdrawal may be manifested as depression. A person withdraws from life, having little hope of enjoying pleasure. This can also be manifested as susceptibility to colds or the flu.
                    After being bathed in the hormones that accompany an action response - cortisol and epinephrine, along with all the other chemicals that are mobilized - T and B Cells, natural killer cells, and a myriad of other cells in the immune system’s arsenal--you are likely to go into withdrawal. It is after an episode of intense emotional strife that you probably will succumb to an infection.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Realize there is nothing wrong with any of these ways of responding. There’s nothing wrong with shutting down and becoming reclusive when the circumstances call for it. You don’t want to be out there interacting with other people, exposing yourself to pathogens, when your immune system isn’t up to the task of protecting you. That’s when you need to be keeping to yourself and conserving energy stores so that they can be drawn upon to mobilize your immune system. And there may be times when you should not be making any decisions - when you should take a time out as you determine how best to proceed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For some people, depression may very well represent a turning point for the better. It may be the point when the person realizes, “Hey, my beliefs and images of reality are not correct. I need to examine my beliefs and set about to create new images of the world.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Of course, there will be a period of confusion during which it’s probably best to do nothing. It’s when you go into withdrawal or depression, and you can’t get out of it that problems will arise – sometimes, requiring a chemical solution to get you back on track. And that, too, is okay.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And there is nothing wrong with taking action and not wasting time engaging in higher processing if your life is in imminent danger, and you need to take evasive action. It’s going into action when you need to be spending additional time in higher processing to ponder other options that there will be negative consequences. Realize also that your personality or coping style may change as you progress from higher processing to withdrawal.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Under stress, it is not unusual for a person who is normally a controller to become an accommodator or the other way around. I learned this when by wife gave birth to our first child. I got caught in that transition period. Prior to that time, it was okay for men to just go off and do their thing. Hunt, drink beer, or play cards, and then wait for a letter to arrive in the mail informing them of the child’s arrival. Things changed during the ’70’s. Men were expected to be there in the delivery room, which is good. It was wonderful to be there.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I can vividly remember my wife going into labor - the contractions were getting closer and closer, and she was in a great deal of personal discomfort. She was unable to form words because of the pain. I knew what she wanted to say to me, though. I knew that had she been able to speak, she would have told me how much she adored me. She would have thanked me for being the means by which she was about to fulfill her dream of becoming a mother. Then, the Lamaze training paid off. The deep breathing exercises kicked in, and the discomfort subsided just enough so that she was able to express herself. She turned to me and looked at me with her loving eyes and said, “Honey - you SOB!”</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was going to explain to her that it was all right and how she had just dropped from higher processing into reptilian mode. And I was going to explain to her all about the polyvagal theory of emotions and tell her that she didn’t really mean what she was saying. Then I decided, “Nah, maybe I’d better just leave it alone.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’m sure you’ve had a similar experience. You’ve been in a group and, all of a sudden, you’ve sat back and said, “I don’t believe that’s Mary. The words she’s using…the way she’s behaving. I’ve never seen this side of her before.” And she’s saying the same thing about you. “What on earth has Harry been smoking? I’ve never seen him behave like this.” The fact is, neither of you has seen the other in their reptilian, or action, mode. And when people start acting in ways that are no longer familiar and which you can no longer predict, it becomes an additional source of conflict, making it even more difficult to resolve problems. You need to be aware that people do change, depending upon their internal, biological environment, just as they change, depending upon their surroundings.</p>
