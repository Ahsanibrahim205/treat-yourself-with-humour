                        </div>
                        <p>Most people know how to experience success. That’s not the problem. The problem is that very few of us know how to adequately recover from failure. As odd as it may sound, it is actually possible to train your body to do so. This is an important ability if you are to reach an elusive goal. There will be setbacks, and, so, having the capability to bounce back in order to continue along your chosen path is paramount if success is to be achieved.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I call it Cross-Stressing because of a principle from learning theory. When I worked for the Office of Naval Research during the 1960’s, we used to go out into the Atlantic Ocean and catch bottlenose dolphins. We’d bring them back, put them into tanks, and train them to push an underwater paddle when they heard a certain sound. When they were first placed into the tank, the animals were clueless. They didn’t know where they were or what they were supposed to be doing. The training was done in gradual stages. As the dolphin swam around the side of the tank, I’d reach out and gently touch it with the paddle, which I simply held in my hand. The moment the touch was applied, I’d toss a fish in its path. , the dolphin would make an association between touching the paddle and getting fed. After that, the paddle was attached to an underwater apparatus that the dolphin swam to on its own volition. This is called successive approximation. It’s the same technique you’d use to train your dog.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You gradually shape the behavior you want to observe and reward each successive step approaching the end-objective. As the animal started moving in toward the paddle, I would play a sound. Now it was only when the animal pressed the paddle after hearing the sound that it got fed. And then I’d change the frequency and the intensity of the sound so that, eventually, it was when the dolphin pressed the paddle in response to only a very specific sound that it would receive a reward. That was the ultimate objective: to teach the animals to discriminate between different auditory signals. It took them several days to learn this very simple task. But once the animal had acquired what was called a learning set, I could substitute other sounds or use visual cues, and the animal would acquire the new test in a fraction of the original time.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Every cell within the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, and even the immune system has the ability to learn to recover from adversity. It is well documented that if the concentration of a chemical increases within the body, there will be a corresponding adjustment in the ability of the receptor to attract the chemical. It’s one of the ways that the body adapts to change. By bathing the body’s cells in stress hormones during their episodic release, the cells learn to recover; and, then, when a major stressor arises, these cells are better able to adapt.</p>
