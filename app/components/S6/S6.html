                    <h1>Conditioned <em>Moods</em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>A few years ago, I became interested in learning how NASA decides who’s going to get the keys to the space shuttle. How do they train a person to be able to handle this awesome responsibility and not become overwhelmed with fear? I had the opportunity to interview Hoot Gibson, the astronaut in charge of recruiting shuttle pilots for NASA. He showed me several, thick manuals. Each contained a standard operating procedure for every contingency that could occur in the space shuttle. The astronauts memorize the more serious ones.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Training consists, in part, of being asked on a moment’s notice, “Smoke in the cockpit. What are you going to do?” The person has to rattle off the protocol, and, of course, they sit in the simulator, pushing the right buttons and flipping the right switches. Not only do they create an explicit or conscious memory of what has to be done by mentally rehearsing it, they also create an implicit or subconscious memory of what has to be done. Implicit memory is what you do automatically without thinking about it. For example, the athlete who automatically moves her body in precisely the right way to score the winning point. Or the concert pianist who can carry on a conversation while the music automatically flows out of his fingers. Explicit memory is what you are consciously aware of. “Where did I leave my keys?” Or, “I’m sorry; I can’t remember your name.” By developing an implicit memory, the astronauts are able to respond so quickly during an emergency that there is no time for an emotion to overwhelm them. They access a new, learned way of responding, instead of resorting to an ancient, perhaps outmoded, response. The practice also instills confidence that they are in control. Remember, it’s when you lack control that problems are going to arise. I’ve used an example of performance. The fact is that you can use this technique for virtually anything. Are you a person who has a difficult time saying no?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Then recall that occasion when you were assertive, and everything turned out just the way you wanted. And practice.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There’s one more thing you need to do. Every time you practice putting yourself into that state of mind, link it to a conditioned stimulus, which will function as the equivalent of Pavlov’s bell. It doesn’t matter what that stimulus is: a photograph, a memento, or, perhaps, a selection of music connected with the occasion. Just choose something that will help put you in that state when you need to be there. A lot of people do this without even realizing it. You do it when you go on vacation, and you buy a souvenir. You stand there at the theme park and gleefully rip off one traveler’s check after another for a cheap piece of junk that you could buy at Wal-Mart for a fraction of the price. But it won’t mean the same thing because what you are really doing is buying a conditioned stimulus – something to help link you with that wonderful experience. Later, in the dead of winter when you’re snowed in, you can now look at the object and be transported in mind and spirit to that wonderful vacation. We do it all the time. We are not simply buying souvenirs; we are buying conditioned stimuli that help us to counteract stress and create moments of happiness.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Do you know that you can tell if people are truly happy by simply walking into their home? You don’t need to know them. You don’t need to know anything about their health, their age, or their gender. All you need to do is spend 30 seconds in their home, and you can tell if they are happy. If what you see before you would give an interior decorator apoplexy, then that person is happy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Over in the corner is a chair that looks as though it has been salvaged from the dump. The spring is breaking through, while the leg appears to have been chewed by a wild animal. Next to it on a shelf, is a Statue of Liberty, a little plastic one with the arm broken off, held on with duct tape. And above it on the wall, is a picture that’s absolutely horrible. The strokes of the brush and the colors match nothing in the room. But, if you were to ask the people who live there about those objects, they probably could tell you a warm and wonderful story about each and every one.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The chair that belonged to their grandparents and the wonderful memories that they experience as they recall having stories told to them as a child. The Statue of Liberty given to them by their spouse on their honeymoon at a time when all they could afford to give each other were cheap trinkets. The picture given to them by their child on the first day of school. I call it therapeutic clutter. Not filth, which is, obviously, very unhealthy. But surrounding yourself with things that are important to you without concern for what others may think. What a wonderful way to recover. If you have a huge amount of stress in your life, what better way to experience recovery than by walking into an environment where everything around you evokes these wonderful memories? By taking these steps, you will help to prevent your biological systems from taking over. You will be able to continue accessing those parts of your brain essential if you are to succeed in doing those things you know you should.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’ve explained how beliefs and images you are consciously aware of can change you. Realize that your body can also be changed by beliefs and images of which you may not be aware. It works through the same principles that I’ve just been talking about –those based upon conditioning.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I want you to imagine, for just a moment, a person sitting in an oncologist’s office, awaiting radiation or chemotherapy. These are immunosuppressive treatments that are designed to destroy rapidly dividing cells, which, of course, is what a tumor is. Unfortunately, lymphocytes, the backbone of the immune system, are also rapidly dividing cells. So the trick is to give as much treatment as possible to destroy a maximum number of tumor cells, but not so much that you destroy all the immune system cells. The doctor wants to make sure that enough survive so that they can replenish and repopulate the various tissues.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Let’s continue. The person is sitting there in the waiting room, flipping through outdated copies of People Magazine, looking at the obligatory fish tank over in the corner because psychologists tell us that fish are soothing, taking in photographs that are hanging on the wall. She receives the treatment, and her immune system goes down. She returns a few weeks later, but this time not for treatment, just to have a blood sample taken to make sure the immune system is rebounding. She looks at the same magazines, the same fish, the same pictures, and, lo and behold, her immune system goes down. What has happened is that those objects have acquired the same property as the bell in Pavlov’s experiment. But, in this case, these objects are now inducing one of the side effects of the original treatment. It doesn’t have to be those objects. It might be the entranceway to the hospital. It might be the song the person was listening to on the radio as she drove into the parking lot, or the taste of the Lifesaver that she was chewing on while awaiting the treatment. Ironically, it might even be the self-help tape she purchased -- the one designed to reduce her anxiety -- which now backfires because she listened to it too close to the treatment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>By the way, what I’ve described is a well-controlled research study performed at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, one of the foremost cancer research and treatment centers in the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is a rather extreme example. There are others, although less well documented. You may not remember what you had for lunch on the day that you were in a car accident. You may not recall what song was on the radio when the telephone rang, and you received some devastating news about the loss of a loved one.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But, thereafter, that same restaurant, that same food, that same song may very well induce the same anxiety-related, physiological response that occurred during the actual event. Your body makes an association between something in the environment and a response, but you are clueless. When you start to feel anxious, and you don’t know what in the world is causing it, that alone can become a secondary source of anxiety.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This happened to me. In 1968, I rode my bicycle in the first running of the Baja 1000, a 1000-mile race across the Baja Desert in Mexico. I was on a bicycle, while everybody else was on a motorcycle or in a dune buggy. Consequently, I started a month before everyone else. Because I couldn’t carry many supplies, I often would share water with coyotes and other wild animals.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It was the nastiest, foulest stuff you can imagine, and I came down with every gastrointestinal symptom in the book. I was a walking microbiology laboratory, and I didn’t get better until I had some good, chlorinated water, which I consumed in copious amounts when I crossed back into America. Do you know that to this day if I drive within two miles of a Mexican restaurant, I get ill? It has been decades since that initial conditioning occurred, and I know what’s causing it; I understand the psychology behind it; I can even trace for you the brain mechanisms that are involved in this learning process. Nonetheless, I continue to have a difficult time shaking this biologically-based belief.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have a friend who loves to fish. However, he’s prone to seasickness. Whenever he went out on his boat, he made certain that he took medication with him. But he never read the directions. Instead of taking the medication before setting foot on the boat and allowing it time to have an effect, he waited until he experienced the initial signs of queasiness. Sure enough, the medication wasn’t designed to work that way, and he would throw up. I realized what he was doing wrong, so I told him to be sure that he took the pills well in advance of setting out the next time that he went fishing. He followed my advice. But within 15 minutes of taking the medication, he threw up. …. And he was still standing on the dock. His body had learned to associate the medication with the symptoms of seasickness. Sometimes, the conditioned response may date back many years.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This happened to a young woman who was happily married. Her husband was hard-working, a great father to their daughter, and a loving, caring partner to her. Everything was seemingly perfect in her life except for the stomachaches that would strike without warning. She went to her internist, who ordered up countless tests, only to find no evidence of anything wrong. He suggested that it was in her mind and that, perhaps, she should see a psychologist. This she did.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The psychologist instructed her to keep a diary, detailing everything surrounding the onset of symptoms. Not just the bouts happening now, but also those in the past. She also was told to recall when they began. After considerable detective work, it was discovered that they started when she was four years old. Her mother had just given birth to twins, and from that moment on, her mother had considerably less time to spend with her. When she became ill, however, she did receive the extra attention for which she yearned.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As an adult, the stomachaches were associated with times when her husband was out of town on a business trip or when he was putting in long hours at the office. She saw the connection immediately. The stomachaches had become associated with getting attention. Sub-consciously, there was a belief encoded within her body that the pain of the stomachaches could lead to the pleasure of affection. Without knowing the cause of the problem, there was no solution. Perhaps a drug to reduce her anxiety. Or medications to lessen the pain once it began. But all they could do was mask the symptoms. The cause of the problem would still have been present, and she would have been exposing herself to powerful drugs with the ability to induce harmful side effects. In her case, just an awareness of the cause was enough to result in an effective solution. Once a tumor or other serious cause could be ruled out, her anxiety was relieved, and she was able to dislodge the biological belief, which stemmed from her childhood.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you are experiencing aches and pains or mental anguish with no apparent cause, follow this protocol to determine if there is a conditioned cause. Keep a detailed diary. Do what the woman with the stomachaches did. Record everything you can think of, no matter how unrelated to the symptoms it might be. The time of day, the weather, what you ate, your level of stress, the songs you heard, even the thoughts that you had. Include it all, and then look for a pattern. You are looking for one thing that always is associated with what is troublesome. Yes, a conditioned stimulus can be de-conditioned, but only if you can identify what it is. Perhaps the answer to the question, “I know what to do, so why don’t I do it?” is just below your conscious radar.</p>
