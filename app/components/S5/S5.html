                            <h1>Taming The Alligators<em> In Your Life</em></h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>When you find yourself plunging into alligator mode, and you know that you might do something that you’ll later regret, you can bring yourself back. Begin by moving your head in the same way as if you were sitting in a rocking chair. Mothers soon figure this out. One of the easiest ways to calm an infant is to gently rock it. And it’s learned without any knowledge of the sensory pathways linking the innermost regions of the ear with the parts of the brain that dampen the sympathetic nervous system. Perhaps this is why John F. Kennedy kept a rocking chair in the Oval Office of the White House. When his lower-back pain overwhelmed the ability of medications to do their job, he found solace through rocking. You might also take a deep breath. Expanding the chest muscles has a way of activating other parts of the nervous system, which also help to dampen an out-of-control action response.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Something else will become apparent as well. You’ll realize it’s wrong to believe you can’t control your stress response. You may not be able to will a change in your autonomic nervous system, but by engaging in the appropriate behaviors, you can indirectly bring about that change.
                            It’s time for a mental break.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Take a deep breath, and imagine you are at the Grand Canyon, standing on the north rim taking in the beautiful, panoramic vista. It’s late in the day, the sun is beginning to set, and the sky is turning beautiful shades of red and orange. You hear the distant cry of birds, while a cool breeze brushes your cheek. And then, you slip. Your body picks up momentum as it begins to turn. Now, imagine reaching out and grabbing a tree branch a split second before plummeting into the canyon below. Make two fists, and hold on as hard as you can. Your life depends upon it. I want you to squeeze to the point that you actually feel uncomfortable. You must hold on for dear life………..</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>All right you can stop.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As you held on to that imaginary branch, did you close your eyes? Many people do when I conduct this exercise at workshops I present. Why would you do that? Oh, I can understand why you might not want to look down, but wouldn’t it make sense to keep your eyes open so that you can see when help might approach? Or, to observe other resources you might use to extricate yourself from the emergency? Or, like others, did you hold your breath? Why on earth would you do that? If there were ever a time to sustain aerobic metabolism, it’s when your life is hanging in the balance. That’s when you need to get oxygen to the muscles.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If you could peer deep inside your brain, you would see in a little place called the nucleus locus coeruleus – and, yes, I agree that the person who came up with that name should be shot - a huge amount of electrical activity and the outpouring of copious amounts of norepinephrine. That brain chemical is increasing the signal to noise ratio. What this means is, it is focusing your attention on what the body considers important at the expense of things that aren’t. If you held your breath, that was a way of conserving energy. Your body was preparing for withdrawal. That might have been fine at one point in our evolutionary history, but not anymore. It no longer has any survival value. Still, under stress, a lot of people revert to old, familiar behaviors that once might have been beneficial, but they no longer are.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>During earthquakes, it is not uncommon for people to climb to the top of a tall building, in the same manner that their ancestor would have climbed a tree to escape a saber -toothed tiger. They see the ground opening up and decide that the best thing to do is put as much distance between themselves and the danger, so they go up. In fact, that’s the worst thing they could do. It’s a very unsafe place to be. And if they were able to engage the higher processing centers of their brain, instead of dropping into action mode, they would be down on the ground, away from any falling objects. But, sometimes, when we leave it up to the body to decide, it will revert to a way of responding that is most familiar.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Early in my career, I conducted a study delving into why whales swim onto beaches and strand themselves. While working on this National Geographic-sponsored study, I concluded that they are reverting to a very primitive behavior, which would have served them well when they used to live on land and, occasionally, ventured into the sea.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>When danger lurks in the form of predatory sharks, they might have escaped the danger by heading to the nearest beach. When they were in a transition stage of evolution similar to where sea lions are today, that would have been a good strategy. However, now it’s extremely detrimental because they no longer have the cooling effect of the water to prevent hyperthermia. Once they’ve been beached for an extended period, they are doomed.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>That’s the kind of thing that can happen if you leave it strictly to the body. It will revert to a primitive belief that may no longer be beneficial. If you haven’t prepared, you’re taking a chance on which familiar way of responding is going to emerge. It’s why you must create new and familiar ways of responding during times of crisis, so that you don’t inappropriately drop into action or withdrawal when better options are available.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>How can you do this? How on earth can you replace ancient ways of responding, dating all the way back to childhood, with a better and equally familiar plan? Very simply. Practice. What athletes refer to as training. What actors call rehearsing. If you saw the Bill Moyer’s production on PBS called Healing and the Mind, you may be familiar with the research I’m going to tell you about. It’s a study that I did with professional actors. I had them perform completely opposite roles. One was a very negative, depressed role. The other was a euphoric, upbeat role. Each play lasted approximately 30 minutes and was performed before different live audiences over a two-week period. Blood samples were drawn before and after every performance to measure the immune system and stress-linked, endocrine profiles of the actors. I also used computerized heart rate monitors to assess sympathetic arousal, a physiological barometer of stress. Then the actors completed the Spielburger State Anxiety Scale to be sure their perception of stress matched their physiology. I also measured the same thing by using the audience, recognizing that how the audience responds to a performance will influence the actors. Briefly, what I found is that when the actor was portraying the negative, depressed role, the immune system went down. But, not when the actor portrayed the upbeat role. By creating a new image using a theatrical script, it is actually possible to change the cells of our internal, healing system.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Acting is something you can learn. Realize that I’m using the word acting as a means by which to elicit a true emotion. A lot of people, when they hear the word acting, think, faking it. “Fake it till you make it,” is a common expression. But that’s not what I’m referring to. You don’t have to be an Oscar-winning actor to be able to use this process as a means to replace old patterns of response with new ones. Think back to that one, glorious moment – hopefully, you’ve had more than one, glorious moment – but, think back to that moment when psychologists would say you were in the flow. Athletes would refer to being in the zone. Everything is clicking. It feels as though you could do whatever you are doing forever, non-stop, and never have to rest. You are loving every moment. Time is just flying. You’ve experienced that feeling. It might have been when your sports team won the divisional championship in high school. It might have been when you received that letter telling you that you had won an award. Recreate that moment. Refer to scrapbooks, talk to friends, and then recall how you were sitting or standing, what music was playing in the background, any aroma that was associated with it. Now create a screenplay based upon that experience, and start rehearsing. Just like actors do. Practice until it becomes a familiar and comfortable way of behaving.</p>
